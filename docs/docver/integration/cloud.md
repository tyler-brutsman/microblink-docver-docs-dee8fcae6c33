# Cloud API

Since BlinkID Verify is distributed in production solely as a self-hosted container, testing against the Cloud API is the best substitute to mimic a production experience without over investing.  

This method of evaluation offers full control over the API through request parameters without having to allocate resources to deploy and host the solution. It can be leveraged in a demo or proof of concept application or invoked through common API platforms like Postman and Inosmnia.

Before you can start sending ID images to the BlinkID Verify Cloud API, a Data Processing Agreement must first be established. Contact your Account Executive or reach out to sales@microblink.com to sign a DPA and get access to API Keys.
