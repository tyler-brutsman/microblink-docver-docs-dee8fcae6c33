# Demo app

For a holistic test using Microblink's front-end components in tandem with the BlinkID Verify API, the simplest approach is to use the Microblink Identity demo application on your desired platform. 

:::note[TODO]
Add links to the demo app for Browser, iOS, Android
:::

This evaluation option is ideal for a low investment assessment that doesn't consume significant resources. Simply compile your test documents, launch the demo app, and begin scanning with BlinkID Verify. 

:::tip[Is it working?]
Be sure to document your results so you can decide whether the solution is achieving your success criteria.

:::warning[Confusing results?]
BlinkID Verify is not a "one size fits all" solution so don't be alarmed if the demo application doesn't produce your desired results. This could mean it's time to test with other evaluation methods that offer greater control over the functionality.
