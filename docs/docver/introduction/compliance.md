# Compliance and Data Privacy

This documentation is focused on the on-premise variant of BlinkID Verify. On-premise Verify runs inside your own infrastructure and doesnâ€™t share any PII data with Microblink in any shape or form. The only data that is shared with Microblink is analytics data that supports billing and debugging. More about analytics data is available here.
